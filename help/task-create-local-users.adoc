OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) enables you to create and manage local WFA users with specific permissions for various roles, such as guest, operator, approver, architect, admin, and backup.

**What you'll need**

You must have installed WFA and logged in as an admin.

**About this task**

WFA enables you to create users for the following roles:

* *Guest*
+
This user can view the portal and the status of a workflow execution, and can be notified of a change in the status of a workflow execution.

* *Operator*
+
This user is allowed to preview and execute workflows for which the user is given access.

* *Approver*
+
This user is allowed to preview, execute, approve, and reject workflows for which the user is given access.
+
NOTE: It is recommended to provide the email ID of the approver. If there are multiple approvers, you can provide a group email ID in the *E-mail* field.

* *Architect*
+
This user has full access to create workflows, but is restricted from modifying global WFA server settings.

* *Admin*
+
This user has complete access to the WFA server.

* *Backup*
+
This is the only user who can remotely generate backups of the WFA server. However, the user is restricted from all other access.
