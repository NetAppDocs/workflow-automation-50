When it is not necessary to cache dictionary objects in OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA), you can disable the caching of these objects. Disabling the caching of unwanted objects can reduce the time taken by WFA to complete data source acquisitions.

. Click *Designer* > *Dictionary*.
. Select the dictionary entry for which you want to disable data acquisition.
. Click image:../media/disable_acquisition_wfa_icon.gif[Disable acquisition icon] on the toolbar, and then click *Yes*.
. If you see the error message Cache acquisition for the dictionary entry cannot be disabled, disable the cache acquisition for the dictionary entries listed in the error message, and then retry disabling the cache acquisition for the current dictionary object.
