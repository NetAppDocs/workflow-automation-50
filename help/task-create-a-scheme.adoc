.About this task

By default, WFA supports two types of schemes: Data Source Acquisition and Other.

* Data Source Acquisition schemes: The tables in these schemes are cached by data sources defined to acquire data from remote systems.
* Other schemes: The tables in these schemes are populated with data through workflows that are customized to solve specific problems.

.Steps

. Log in to WFA through a web browser as an administrator or architect.
. Click *Designer* > *Schemes*.
. Create a new scheme by clicking image:../media/new_wfa_icon.gif[New icon] on the toolbar.
. Enter the required information such as the name, type, description, and entity version of the scheme in the New Schemes dialog box.
. Click *Save*.
