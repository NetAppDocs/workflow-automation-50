== Active Directory Groups table

The Active Directory Groups window displays existing Active Directory groups. You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The following table lists the supported operators for alphabetic and numeric columns in the Active Directory Groups table, available from the *Search* filter text box.
