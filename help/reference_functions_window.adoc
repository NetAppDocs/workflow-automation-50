The Functions window displays the available OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) functions and enables you to manage these functions.

Functions are complementary tools for performing significant or black-boxed operations that are required for planning workflow executions. Functions are processed during the planning phase. Functions can be used to complete repetitive and complex tasks, such as defining a complex naming convention. Functions run in their own sandbox and might use other functions during execution. Functions are written in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL).

== Functions table

The Functions table lists the available WFA functions. Each entry is identified as one of the following:

* No icon - content created by users
* image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[] - content developed by Professional Services (PS), which is available only on custom installations made by PS
* image:../media/community_certification.gif[] - packs developed by users
* image:../media/lock_icon_wfa.gif[] - content created by users that is locked
* image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[] - NetApp-certified content

You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The Functions table contains the following columns:

* *Certification*
