== Workflow table

The Workflow table lists the workflows submitted for execution. You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The following table outlines the supported operators for alphabetic and numeric columns in the Workflow table, available in the *Search* filter text box.

The Workflow table contains the following columns:

* *Job #*
+
Displays the identification number of the job.
+
The job identification number is unique and is assigned by the server when it starts the job.

* *Name*
+
Displays the name of the workflow.

* *Start Time*
+
Displays the date and time when the workflow was started.
+
Click the calendar icon in the Search filter text box to search for workflows with a specific start date.

* *End Time*
+
Displays the date and time when the workflow ended.
+
Click the calendar icon in the Search filter text box to search for workflows with a specific end date.

* *Status*
+
Displays the running status of the job. The status can be one of the following:

 ** Failed
+
Indicates that the workflow failed during execution. Based on the time that has elapsed since the execution of the workflow, you can resume the workflow from the failed command.

 ** Executing
+
Indicates that the workflow is being executed. The workflow executes the plan that was created in the planning phase, which precedes any other execution.

 ** Successful
+
Indicates that the workflow has been successfully executed.

 ** Canceled
+
Indicates that the workflow has been canceled by a user.

 ** Waiting for Approval
+
Indicates that an approval point is part of the workflow. The workflow remains in this state until the specified user approves the workflow execution.

 ** Scheduled
+
Indicates that the planning of the workflow is complete and the workflow is scheduled for execution.

 ** Aborting
+
Indicates that the workflow is being aborted. An aborted workflow does not continue with the execution; any previously completed part of the workflow remains completed.

 ** Obsolete
+
Indicates that the scheduled workflow has not been executed within the specified time per the schedule.

 ** Planning
+
Indicates the resolution of the workflow design, location of all resources, verification of design viability, and formulation of the execution plan. Planning can be a stand-alone action, part of the design verification, or part of execution because every execution starts with a fresh planning.

 ** Pending
+
Indicates that the workflow is in the planning queue. This is an internal status. The workflow is retrieved for planning from this status.

 ** Partially Successful
+
Indicates that although the workflow has been successfully executed, there are one or more steps that have failed. The execution is completed because the failed steps have been configured such that the workflow execution continues even when the step has failed.

* *Completed*
+
Displays the number of steps that are completed of the total number of steps for the selected workflow.

* *Submitted By*
+
Displays the user name of the user who submitted the workflow.

* *Submitted At*

* *Execution Comment*
+
Displays the comment specified for the workflow execution.

* *Scheduled For*
+
Displays the scheduled date and time for the execution of the workflow.
+
Click the calendar icon in the Search filter text box to search for workflows with a specific scheduled for date.When a filter to view the jobs at a later date is applied on the column, jobs with "`Job # zero`" might be displayed. This indicates that the job is not yet created and will be created at the scheduled time.

* *Recurring ID*
+
Displays the identifier of the recurring schedule.

* *Schedule Name*
+
Displays the name of the schedule.

* *Last Status Change*
+
Displays the time when a status was changed.
+
Click the calendar icon in the Search filter text box to search for workflows with a specific last status change date.

* *Approval Point Comment*
+
Indicates the message that is displayed to the user at the last approval point, if applicable, during the execution of the workflow.
