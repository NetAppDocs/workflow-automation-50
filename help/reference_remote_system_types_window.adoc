The Remote System Types window displays the type of remote systems that OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) can work with. The remote systems include clustered Data ONTAP, Cloud Manager, OnCommand Unified Manager, DataFabric Manager server, and E-Series systems.

== Remote System Types table

The remote system types table lists in tabular format the remote systems that WFA can work with. You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.

* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
