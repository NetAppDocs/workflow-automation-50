The Data Source Types window displays the available data source types. You can manage the data source types from this window.

A data source type is used to define a data source, which contains information about where the data in a specific database originates from and the method used to acquire data from the data source. For example, a data source can be either an OnCommand Unified Manager database that contains information about a storage environment or a VMware database with information about a data center.

== Data Source Types table

The Data Source Types table lists the available data source types. Each entry is identified as one of the following:

* No icon - content created by users
* image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[] - content developed by Professional Services (PS), which is available only on custom installations made by PS
* image:../media/community_certification.gif[] - packs developed by users
* image:../media/lock_icon_wfa.gif[] - content created by users that is locked
* image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[] - NetApp-certified content

You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The Data Source Types table contains the following columns:

* *Certification*

Indicates whether the data source type is user-created (no icon, empty cell), PS (image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[]), community (image:../media/community_certification.gif[]), user-locked (image:../media/lock_icon_wfa.gif[]), or NetApp-certified (image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[]).
