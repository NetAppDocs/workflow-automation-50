The Templates window displays the available templates in alphabetical order. A template is a collection of settings that can be used when creating workflows. You can use templates to create workflows quickly.

== Templates table

The Templates table lists the available templates. Each entry is identified as one of the following:

* No icon - content created by users
* image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[] - content developed by Professional Services (PS), which is available only on custom installations made by PS
* image:../media/community_certification.gif[] - packs developed by users
* image:../media/lock_icon_wfa.gif[] - content created by users that is locked
* image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[] - NetApp-certified content

You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.
