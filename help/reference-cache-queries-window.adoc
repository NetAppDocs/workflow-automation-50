The Cache Queries window enables you to manage cache queries for the WFA dictionary entries and their associated data source types.

A cache query is an SQL query that retrieves the required data from the table specified in the query. A cache query is associated with a dictionary entry and one or more data source types--for example, cache query for *Volume (storage)* is associated with both OnCommand Unified Manager 5.1 and 5.2 data source types. You can define a cache query when you want retrieve some information, such as volume from a table of a data source OnCommand Unified Manager 6.0 into WFA's cache.

== Cache Queries list

The Cache Queries table lists the dictionary entries and their associated data source types. You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The Cache Queries table contains the following columns:

* *Certification*

Indicates whether the cache query is user-created (no icon, empty cell), PS (image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[]), community (image:../media/community_certification.gif[]), user-locked (image:../media/lock_icon_wfa.gif[]), or NetApp-certified (image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[]).

* *Scheme*
