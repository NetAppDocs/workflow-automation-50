The Credentials window enables you to view, create, edit, and delete credentials. You can access this window by selecting *Settings* > *Setup* > *Credentials*.

Credentials are information (such as IP address or host name, user name and password) that is stored on a target system (server or controller) and is used to connect to that specific system and to execute commands.

* Credentials table
* Toolbar

== Credentials table

The Credentials window displays existing credentials in a table format. You can customize the table display by using the filtering and sorting features available for each column, as well as by rearranging the column order.

* image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] enables or disables filtering for the entire table. A red "x" appears over the icon if filtering is disabled.
* Double-clicking image:../media/filter_icon_wfa.gif[Filter icon] clears and resets the filtering selections.
* image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] on each column header enables you to filter based on the content of the columns. Clicking image:../media/wfa_filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] in a column allows you to filter on a specific item from the drop-down list or on all available items.
* Clicking the column header toggles between ascending and descending order of sorting. You can identify the applied sort order by the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon] for ascending and image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] for descending).
* To rearrange the location of columns, you can drag and drop columns to place them in any required order. However, you cannot hide or delete any of these columns.
* Clicking the *Search* filter text box allows you to search for specific content. In addition, you can search using supported operators for the applicable column type, Alphabetic or Numeric.

The following table lists the supported operators for alphabetic and numeric columns in the Credentials table, available from the *Search* filter text box.

The Credentials table contains the following columns:

* *Type*
+
Displays the type of credential.

* *Name/IP Address*
+
Displays the IP address for the credential.

* *Host Name*
+
Displays the host name for the credential.

* *Login*
+
Displays the user name associated with the credential.

* *Match*
+
Displays the match type for the credential. Match types are as follows:

 ** Exact: defines credentials for a specific IP address or host name
 ** Pattern: defines credentials for the entire subnet or IP range, or host name range
+
Pattern is a regular expression that is used for matching a string--for example, `10.10.10.*` matches any IP address in the range 10.10.10.0 through 10.10.10.255, and `host*` matches host names starting with the string `host`.
