The Workflow <workflow name> window displays the selected workflow and its associated commands and parameters. The commands associated with the workflow are displayed as blue boxes in columns that are arranged in the sequential order of execution--left to right. The variables and objects for each command are displayed as gray boxes below the command.

== Workflow tab

The Workflow tab enables you to select and use child workflows and commands, and customize the display name.

* *Available Steps*
+
Provides a list of available child workflows and commands that you can add to your workflow.
+
You can search for child workflows or commands by using the name, scheme, and minimum software version as search strings in the text box.
+
You can customize the workflow display by rearranging the order of the commands. To rearrange the commands, you can drag and drop commands in the required order. Double-clicking a command moves that command to the end of the list. You can modify the display name by double-clicking the display name of the command in the blue box. You can delete a command by moving the cursor over the blue box, and then clicking "`X`" on the upper-right corner.
+
You can click the row number to perform various functions on the row.

 ** *Insert a row*
+
Inserts a new row above or below the selected row in the workflow.

 ** *Copy row*

Copies the selected row from the workflow and saves it to the clipboard. The repetition details set for the row is copied when a row is copied.

 ** *Repeat row*
+
Opens the Row Repetition Details dialog box, which enables you to specify the type of repetition.

 ** *Add condition*

* *Enable element existence validation*
+
Enables you to validate the existence of elements and avoid failure of certain actions during the execution of workflows. For example, you can avoid creating a new volume in an array with the same name as that of an existing volume.
