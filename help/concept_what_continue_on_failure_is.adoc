The continue on failure feature helps you to configure a step in a workflow so that the workflow execution can continue even if the step fails. You can address the failed steps and resolve the issue that caused the step to fail by accessing the wfa.log file or by clicking the image:../media/info_icon_execute_wfa.gif[] icon.

A workflow that has one or more such failed steps is in the Partially Successful state after the execution is complete. You can configure a step so that the workflow execution continues even if the step fails by selecting the required option in the Advanced tab of the Parameters for <command_name> dialog box.

If a step is not configured to continue on failure, the workflow execution is aborted if the step fails.

If a step that is configured to continue on failure fails, you can set the workflow to be executed by using one of the following options:

* Abort workflow execution (default option)
* Continue execution from the next step
* Continue execution from the next row
