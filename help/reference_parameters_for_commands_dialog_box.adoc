You can specify parameters and other settings for the execution of commands through the Parameters for commands dialog box.

The dialog box displays one or more dictionary object tabs and the following tabs:

* Other parameters
* Advanced

== <Dictionary objects> tabs

* *Define <dictionary object>*
+
Enables you to specify the command parameters that are mapped to the dictionary object by specifying attributes, using a previously defined object, or searching for an existing object.

 ** *by filling-in attributes*
+
Enables you to enter attributes for this variable. You can use the Resource Selection dialog box for fields marked with image:../media/resource_selection_icon_wfa.gif[]. Optionally, you can use a template that includes predefined values for certain attributes of the object. You can view and use additional attributes by clearing the *Show only attributes used by <dictionary object>* check box. The box next to *Define <dictionary object>* displays the default name of the selected variable. You can edit the name of the variable. The mandatory attributes are marked with an asterisk (*) and red border for the box.

 ** *by using a previously defined <dictionary object>*
+
Enables you to select a previously defined variable. You can select the previously defined dictionary object in the box next to *Define <dictionary object>*.

 ** *by searching for an existing <dictionary object>*
+
Enables you to define a variable by searching for an existing dictionary object. You can specify the search criteria for the dictionary object. You can specify one of the following action if the dictionary object is found:

  *** Abort workflow
  *** Disable the command
  *** Fill-in attributes for the <dictionary object> and execute the command
+
NOTE: This option is similar to the *by filling-in attributes* option.

== Other Parameters
