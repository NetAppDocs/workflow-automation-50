== Status area

The Status area above the tabs displays detailed information about the result of the planning or execution process.

* *Workflow status*
+
At the top of the window, a color-coded header displays the result of the planning or execution process:

 ** Green indicates a successful action--for example, Planning Completed or Execution Completed.
 ** Red indicates failure--for example, Planning Failed or Execution Failed.

* *Less/More info action*
+
This action link is available when the preview or execution process fails. You can toggle between *Less info* and *More info* using the action link. Depending on the action, the link opens or closes the information box to show more or less information about the failed result.

* *Detailed status*
+
This box is available when the preview or execution process fails. It displays details about the planning or execution process. When a process fails, this box is open by default and provides details of the cause of the failure.

== Flow tab

The Flow tab provides a graphical presentation of the workflow.

Commands and child workflows are displayed in the top row with their objects and variables displayed below. The status of the command details and child workflows during preview or execution is displayed using various colors.

The following table shows the following:

* The color scheme used to display the status of the command or workflow execution
* The icons used in the window

The Details tab provides more detailed information about the workflow. The information is provided in table format, with the commands in the header row and the associated objects and variables listed below. This tab provides each command with all of its arguments and parameters.

This tab is useful for debugging a failed preview or execution of the workflow.

You can use this tab for debugging a failed preview or execution of the workflow.

== User Inputs tab

The User Inputs tab displays values entered by users during the preview or execution of the workflow.

You can use the sort arrows (image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_down_icon.gif[Sort down icon] or image:../media/wfa_sortarrow_up_icon.gif[Sort up icon]) in the column header to sort the column entries in ascending or descending order.

== Return Parameters tab

The Return Parameters tab lists the output of the workflow, by parameter name and parameter value.

You can access these return parameters by using web services.

== History tab

The History tab lists changes in the statuses for the workflow, when the status change occurred, who initiated the action, and the message associated with the status change.
