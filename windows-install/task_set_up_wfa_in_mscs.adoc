You can install and configure Workflow Automation (WFA) in a Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS) environment to set up high availability and provide failover. Before you install WFA, you must verify that all the required components are configured correctly.

*About this task*

A high-availability setup provides constant support for application operations. If one of the components fails, the mirrored component in the setup takes over the operation and provides uninterrupted network resources.

NOTE: MSCS is the only clustering solution that is supported by WFA in Windows.
