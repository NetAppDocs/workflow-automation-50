You must set up a connection with a data source in OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) to acquire data from the data source.

*What you'll need*

* For Active IQ Data Center Manager versions earlier than 6.0, you must have run the latest version of the ocsetup tool on the Data Center Manager server to enable and configure remote read-only access to the database.
* For Active IQ Data Center Manager6.0 and later, you must have created a database user account on the Data Center Manager server.
+
See the _OnCommand Unified Manager Online Help_ for details.

* The TCP port for incoming connections on the Data Center Manager server must be open.
+
See the documentation on your firewall for details.
+
The following are the default TCP port numbers:
+
[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
| TCP port number| Data Center Manager server version| Description
a|
2638
a|
5.x
a|
Sybase SQL Anywhere database server
a|
3306
a|
6.x
a|
MySQL database server
|===

* For Performance Advisor, you must have created an Active IQ Data Center Manager user account with a minimum role of GlobalRead.
+
See the _OnCommand Unified Manager Online Help_ for details.

* For VMware vCenter Server, you must have created a user account on the vCenter Server.
+
See the VMware vCenter Server documentation for details.
+
NOTE: You must have installed VMware PowerCLI. If you want to execute workflows only on vCenter Server data sources, setting up Data Center Manager server as a data source is not required.

* The TCP port for incoming connections on the VMware vCenter Server must be open.
+
The default TCP port number is 443. See the documentation on your firewall for details.

*About this task*

You can add multiple Data Center Manager server data sources to WFA using this procedure. However, you must not use this procedure if you want to pair Data Center Manager server 6.3 and later with WFA and use the protection functionality in Data Center Manager server.

For more information about pairing WFA with Data Center Manager server 6.x, see the _OnCommand Unified Manager Online Help_.

NOTE: While setting up a data source with WFA, you must be aware that Active IQ Data Center Manager 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 data source types are deprecated in the WFA 4.0 release, and these data source types will not be supported in future releases.

.Steps
. Access WFA using a web browser.
. Click *Settings*, and under *Setup* click *Data Sources*.
. Choose the appropriate action:

|===
If you have added a Data Center Manager server data source to WFA and then upgraded the version of the Data Center Manager server, WFA will not recognize the upgraded version of the Data Center Manager server. You must delete the previous version of the Data Center Manager server and then add the upgraded version of the Data Center Manager server to WFA.

. In the *New Data Source* dialog box, select the required data source type, and enter a name for the data source and the host name.
+
Based on the selected data source type, the port, user name, password, and timeout fields might be automatically populated with the default data, if available. You can edit these entries as required.
