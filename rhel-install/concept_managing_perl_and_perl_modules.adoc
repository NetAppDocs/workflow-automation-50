OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) supports Perl commands for workflow operations. You can install and configure your preferred Perl distribution and Perl modules.

The required Perl modules from the NetApp Manageability SDK are also installed when you install WFA. The NetApp Manageability SDK Perl modules are required for successful execution of Perl commands.

You can install additional Perl modules, if required, from the Red Hat package repositories or from the CPAN repositories.
