You can back up the OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) database from the web portal and use the backup file for data recovery purposes. You cannot perform a full backup from the web portal.

You must have admin or architect credentials to perform this task.

A WFA user with backup role cannot log in to the web portal to perform a backup. The WFA users with backup role can only perform remote or scripted backups.

. Log in to the WFA web GUI as an admin.
. Click *Settings* and under *Maintenance*, click *Backup & Restore*.
. Click *Backup*.
. In the dialog box that opens, select a location, and then save the file.
