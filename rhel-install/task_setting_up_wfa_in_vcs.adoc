You must install and configure Workflow Automation (WFA) in a Veritas Cluster Server (VCS) environment to set up high availability and provide failover. Before you install WFA, you must verify that all required components are configured correctly.

*About this task*

A high-availability setup provides constant support for application operations. If one of the components fails, the mirrored component in the setup takes over the operation and provides uninterrupted network resources.

NOTE: VCS is the only clustering solution that is supported by WFA on Linux.
