* You must have access to the WFA content that you want to import.
* The content that you want to import must have been created on a system that is running the same version or an earlier version of WFA.
+

* Content developed on N-2 versions of WFA can only imported into WFA 5.0.
* If the .dar file references NetApp-certified content, the NetApp-certified content packs must be imported.
