You can configure the credentials of a target system in OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) and use the credentials to connect to that specific system and execute commands.

*About this task*

After initial data acquisition, you must configure the credentials for the arrays on which the commands are run. PowerShell WFA controller connection works in two modes:

* With credentials
+
WFA tries to establish a connection using HTTPS first, and then tries using HTTP. You can also use Microsoft Active Directory LDAP authentication to connect to arrays without defining credentials in WFA. To use Active Directory LDAP, you must configure the array to perform authentication with the same Active Directory LDAP server.

* Without credentials (for storage systems operating in 7-Mode)
+
WFA tries to establish a connection using domain authentication. This mode uses the remote procedure call protocol, which is secured using the NTLM protocol.

.Steps
. Log in to WFA through a web browser as an admin.
. Click *Settings*, and under *Setup* click *Credentials*.
. Click image:../media/new_wfa_icon.gif[New icon] on the toolbar.
. In the *New Credentials* dialog box, select one of the following options from the *Match* list:
 ** *Exact*
+
Credentials for a specific IP address or host name

 ** *Pattern*
+
Credentials for the entire subnet or IP range
+
You can use regular expression syntax for this option.
. Select the remote system type from the *Type* list.
. Enter either the host name or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the resource, the user name, and the password.
. Test the connectivity by performing the following action:
