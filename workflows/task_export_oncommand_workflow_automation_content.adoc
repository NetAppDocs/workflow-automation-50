You can save user-created OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) content as a .dar file and share the content with other users. The WFA content can include the entire user-created content or specific items such as workflows, finders, commands, and dictionary terms.

*What you'll need*

* You must have access to the WFA content that you want to export.
* If content that is to be exported contains references to certified content, the corresponding certified content packs must be available on the system when the content is imported.
+
These packs can be downloaded from the Storage Automation Store.

*About this task*

* You cannot export the following types of certified content:
 ** image:../media/netapp_certified.gif[] - NetApp-certified content
 ** image:../media/ps_certified_icon_wfa.gif[] - content developed by Professional Services (PS), which is available only on custom installations made by PS
 ** image:../media/community_certification.gif[] - packs developed by users
* All of the objects that are dependent on the exported object are also exported.
+
For example, exporting a workflow also exports the dependent commands, filters, and finders for the workflow.

* You can export locked objects.
+
The objects remain in the locked state when they are imported by other users.

.Steps
. Log in to WFA through a web browser.
