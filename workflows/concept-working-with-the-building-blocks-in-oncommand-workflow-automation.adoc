The Workflow Automation (WFA) workflows consist of several building blocks and WFA includes a library of the predefined building blocks. You can use the building blocks that WFA provides to create workflows that match the requirements of your organization.

WFA provides the structure for storage automation processes. WFA's flexibility is based on how the workflows are constructed by using the workflow building blocks.

The WFA building blocks are as follows:

* Dictionary entries
* Commands
* Filters
* Finders
* Functions
* Templates

You should understand how the building blocks are used in WFA to help you in creating the workflows.
