You must create a data source type to enable data acquisition from a data source, which is not predefined in OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA).

* You must have created the required dictionary entry and scheme if you are creating a custom data source type that is not predefined in WFA.
* You must be aware of PowerShell scripting to create a data source type that uses the script method.

. Click *Designer* > *Data Source Types*.
. Click image:../media/new_wfa_icon.gif[New icon] on the toolbar.
. In the New Data Source Type dialog box, enter or select the required details in the *Data source*, *Data source version*, and *Scheme* fields.

. From the *Method* list, select the method that WFA must use to acquire data:
