You can integrate the OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) pack with the Source Control Management (SCM) repository.

You must have admin or architect credentials.

SCM tools such as GitHub, Perforce, and SVN require you to map a local directory to check out the code from the SCM repository server. This local directory mapping is called the SCM client location. You must set up the SCM client with a file system location as a client area.

You can set up the SCM client on a WFA server system. You must have access to the WFA server system for SCM operations
