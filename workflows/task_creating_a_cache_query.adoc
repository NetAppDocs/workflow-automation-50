You can define a cache query when you want to cache information about a dictionary object in the WFA database from a data source type. You can create a cache query and associate it with a dictionary entry and one or more data source types, such as OnCommand Unified Manager 6.1.

*What you'll need*

You must know the appropriate SQL syntaxes to create a cache query.

.Steps
. Click *Designer* > *Cache Queries*.
. Click image:../media/new_wfa_icon.gif[New icon] on the toolbar.
. In the *Add Cache Query* dialog box, select the required dictionary entry and data source type.
. In the "`SQL select query`" section, enter the appropriate SQL query.

The following SQL query caches information about the disk dictionary object from the OnCommand Unified Manager 6.1 data source type:
+
----
SELECT
    disk.objId AS id,
    disk.name AS NAME,
    disk.uid AS uid,
    disk.effectiveInterfaceType AS TYPE,
    disk.rpm AS rpm,
    disk.homeNodeId AS home_node_id,
    disk.ownerNodeId AS owner_node_id,
    disk.model AS model,
    disk.serialNumber AS serial_number,
    disk.totalBytes/1024/1024 AS size_mb,
    disk.shelf AS shelf,
    disk.shelfBay AS shelf_bay,
    disk.pool AS pool,
    disk.vendor AS vendor,
    LOWER(disk.raidPosition) AS raid_position,
    disk.containerTypeRaw AS container_type,
    disk.clusterId AS cluster_id
FROM
    netapp_model_view.disk disk
