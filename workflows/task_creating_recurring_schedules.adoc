OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) provides two scheduling options for workflows. You can either schedule a workflow to execute once at a specific time or you can create recurring schedules and associate the schedules to workflows so that the workflows are executed routinely.

*About this task*

A schedule that you have created can be reused and associated with several workflows.

.Steps
. Click *Execution* > *Schedules*.
. Click image:../media/new_wfa_icon.gif[New icon] on the toolbar.
. In the *New Schedule* dialog box, enter or select a name, description, and frequency for the schedule.
+
For frequency, you must enter time in 24-hour format. The WFA server time is applied to the schedules.

. Click *OK*.

* You can associate the schedule to a workflow when you execute the workflow by using the *Execute recurrently* option.
* You can view the details of a workflow and its association with a schedule by clicking *Execution* > *Recurring Schedules*.
+
The resource and execution planning for the workflows that are scheduled to execute once are done immediately when the workflows are schedules. However, the resource and execution planning for the workflows with recurring schedule occur at the scheduled time and not when the schedule is associated with a workflow.
