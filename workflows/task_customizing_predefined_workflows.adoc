You can customize a predefined Workflow Automation (WFA) workflow if there is no predefined workflow that is suitable for your requirement.

You must have identified the required modifications for the predefined workflow.

Questions and support request for the following must be directed to the WFA community:

* Any content downloaded from the WFA community
* Custom WFA content that you have created
* WFA content that you have modified

. Click *Designer* > *Workflows*.
. Select the predefined workflow that closely matches your requirement, and then click image:../media/clone_wfa_icon.gif[Clone icon] on the toolbar.
. In the workflow designer, make the required changes in the appropriate tabs, such as editing the description, adding or deleting a command, modifying the command details, and modifying the user input.
. Click *Preview*, enter the required user inputs to preview the workflow execution, and then click *Preview* to view the planning details of the workflow.
. Click *OK* to close the preview window.
. Click *Save*.

You can test the workflow that you modified in your test environment, and then mark the workflow as ready for production.
