You can use WFA filters in your workflows to select the required resources.

A WFA filter is an SQL-based query that works on the WFA database. Each filter returns a list of elements of a specific dictionary type. The returned elements are based on the selection criteria specified in the SQL query. You must be aware of SQL syntaxes to create or edit a filter.
